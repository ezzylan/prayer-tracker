# PrayEZ

A simple web-based Islamic prayer tracker built with Nuxt.

## Features

-   Track today's prayers
-   Track missed prayers
-   Show today's prayer times (Malaysia only)

> #### Sidenote ðŸ’¡
>
> -   Prayer times are based on [JAKIM's e-Solat Portal](https://www.e-solat.gov.my/index.php). So, the prayer times and zones' GET APIs are hardcoded to the portal's URL.
> -   Feel free to contribute to add configuration for prayer times and zones from other countries âœ¨
